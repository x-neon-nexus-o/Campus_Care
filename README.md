## 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide

### **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account) - [Setup guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/campus-care.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd campus-care
```

### **Step 2: Backend Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Create environment variables file
cp .env.example .env
```

### **Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with the following configuration:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000

# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/campuscare"
# For MongoDB Atlas, use your connection string:
# MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/campuscare"

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-here"

# Email Configuration (for password reset)
EMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-app-password"

# Optional: Admin Configuration
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@famt.ac.in"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin@123"
```

### **Step 4: Frontend Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory (from project root)
cd frontend

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

### **Step 5: Database Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Seed the database with default admin user
npm run seed:admin

# Optional: Create additional admin users
npm run admin list
```

### **Step 6: Start the Application**

**Option A: Development Mode (Recommended)**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Backend Server
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Start Frontend Development Server
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Option B: Production Mode**
```bash
# Build frontend for production
cd frontend
npm run build

# Start backend server
cd ../backend
npm start
```

### **Step 7: Access the Application**
- **Frontend**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3002`
- **Backend API**: Available at `http://localhost:5000`
- **Admin Panel**: Login with `admin@famt.ac.in` / `admin@123`

### **🔧 Troubleshooting**
- **Port conflicts**: Change the PORT in `.env` if 5000 is already in use
- **Database connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or check your Atlas connection string
- **Email issues**: Verify your email credentials and enable "Less secure app access" for Gmail
